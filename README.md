# Advent of Code

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! Inside this repository, you'll discover separate folders for each year. Each year's folder contains Python files for the daily puzzles.

Note that I haven't completed every day (or year) yet, so don't be surprised to find some gaps now and then.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/miles-lenz/advent-of-code.git
```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional)
```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Create an  `input.txt` file at the root level of the directory.
2. Paste in the puzzle input for the day you want to try out.
3. Run the corresponding Python file.

That's it! Have fun with my solutions.
